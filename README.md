# Vanilla node REST API

A CRUD rest api using *node.js*, *nodemon* & *uuid*.

## Prerequisites

You need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

## Installation

- Clone the repo
- In a terminal, run `npm install`
- To start the node server, run `npm run dev`

## Version control (git)

- Progress is divided into different branches. They're named starting with a number, for example `1-project-setup`

## Tools

### Nodemon

[Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) is used to avoid having to restart the node server after making changes.

### uuid

[uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) helps us create id's.

## Code organisation

Code is organized with the following folders:

- data - dummy data in the form of products
